Excited to share that Iâ€™ve started a new phase of my Linux journey with Al-Razzaq Labs (Red Hat System Administration II) at Alnafi International College ðŸŽ“
Here are the first set of labs Iâ€™ve completed:
1. Advanced Bash History and Search
2. Aliases and Functions
3. Command Substitution
4. Brace Expansion and Globbing
5. Job Control (fg %!, bg %1, jobs)

ðŸ’¡ These labs are sharpening my command-line automation, Bash scripting, and shell management skills â€” taking my Red Hat expertise to the next level of system administration.
